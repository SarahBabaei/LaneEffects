For our original dataset, post-sequencing reads had an average quality of 35, and an average of 2,760,999 reads per individual. After SNP filtering, there were 646 individuals and 34,084 SNPs in the full dataset and 606 individuals and 25,458 SNPs in the neutral dataset. 25,458 neutral SNPs were retained from 606 individuals, 280 of which were from 3Ps.
Our follow-up dataset gave 3,050,194,533 reads. The neutral dataset has 38,127 SNPs, 47 individuals from 3Ps, 92 from the Northern stock complex, 102 from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence stocks, 12 from the Bay of Fundy, and 33 from the Gulf of Maine.
